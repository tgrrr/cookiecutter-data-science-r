# Bayesian Australian Charity analysis

by: Phil Steinke phil@tgrrr.com

## Introduction*

Baysian analysis of expected charity donations
TODO: Notes about charities
struggling with Covid

## Data Inspection

```{r}
data_child_docs <- "_data.Rmd"
```
```{r, child = data_child_docs}
```

# Prior (15%):
<!-- Rubric:
- Specify suitable prior distributions and specify appropriate values for the parameters of prior distributions (15%)
- All the prior distributions match with the domain of the corresponding parameter
- suitable explanations on the prior knowledge and the degree of belief in it are given
- both mean and variance of the prior distribution reflect the prior information and the degree of belief in the prior in a suitable way
- suitable priors are specified for model selection
- different prior distributions or parameter values have been considered to assess the sensitivity of results to the prior distributions. -->

```{r}
prior_child_docs <- "_prior.Rmd"
```
```{r, child = prior_child_docs}
```

# Model

```{r}
model_child_docs <- "_model.Rmd"
```
```{r, child = model_child_docs}
```

# Model diagram:

<!-- Rubric:
- Prepare a suitable JAGS model daigram and reflect it on the model text for JAGS implementation (%10)
- A model diagram and the corresponding model text is provided
- model selection is considered and implemented correctly
- in the model diagram and the corresponding model text, there are some attempts to improve the model to run the MCMC faster and these attempts are clearly articulated in the report.
Apply the Bayes theorem
JAGS implements the correct model and the model diagram shows the correct model with no errors -->

# Posterior Distribution (15%)

<!-- Rubric:
- Interpret the posterior distributions, Bayesian point and interval estimates and conduct hypothesis tests in an informative way
- The Bayesian point and interval estimates are interpreted correctly in a comparative way to demonstrate the impact of informativeness. 
- Hypothesis tests are conducted using suitable results
- The results are interpreted in a way to fulfil the given tasks, they are linked to the tasks
- Multiple prior distributions are used to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results in all tasks to the changes in the degree of informativeness
There is no unsuitable/incorrect interpretation of the results.  -->

```{r}
posterior_child_docs <- "_posterior.Rmd"
```
```{r, child = posterior_child_docs}
```


# Diagnostics (15%):
<!-- Rubric:
- the reason behind doing the adjustments are explained clearly
- the results are articulated in a way to demonstrate a good understanding of diagnostic checking
- the efficiency of the implemented MCMC method is improved by suitable adjustments in burn-in, number of chains and thinning

- Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic checking to validate the assumptions of the fitted models
- All the tools/statistics/measures covered in the course for diagnostic checking are applied and both representativeness and accuracy of the generated chains are validated
- the comments made on the results are all correct and suitable
- Apply the Bayes theorem 		 -->
<!-- Residuals Error Checking -->

```{r}
model_child_docs <- "_diagnosistics.Rmd"
```
```{r, child = model_child_docs}
```

## Analysis

```{r}
analysis_child_docs <- "_analysis.Rmd"
```
```{r, child = analysis_child_docs}
```

## Conclusion

<!-- TODO: CHECK AT THE END
# Report (25%):
	- every single table/figure has a figure/table number and an informative title
	- a technically sound (correct) comment made on each presented output

âœ” Presentation (5%) @created(20-11-11 16:48) @done(20-11-11 16:48)

# Quality of data (5%):
	- Problem solved with the analysis of data is described in a very clear way to highlight its practical importance

# Code (10%):
- suitable explanations are given on the code
- suitable title, axes- labels, and legends are added on the plots by the codes -->
