# Cookiecutter Data Science

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work **(in R)**._ 

### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:

Even though this is for R, cookiecutter still requries Python to setup and install

-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```

### To start a new project, run:
------------

```zsh
$ cookiecutter github.com/tgrrr/cookiecutter-data-science-r
